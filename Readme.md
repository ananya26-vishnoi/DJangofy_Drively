 # Installation



When you verify your Git account, any project you create will be automatically pushed to your GitHub account. From there, you can easily clone the project to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/<Project Name>.git
```

If you haven't verified your Git account, don't worry! You can still download the project as a zip file and extract it to your local machine. This option is provided at the last step of project creation, so you can easily access and work with the files even without a Git account.

# Setup

## Virtual Environment


To ensure a clean and organized development environment, it is highly recommended to use a virtual environment when working with any project. You can create a virtual environment for your project by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv <name of virtual environment>
```

Once your virtual environment is created, you can activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system.

Windows:
```bash
.\<name of virtual environment>\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Unix:
```bash
source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate
```

By activating your virtual environment, you can ensure that any dependencies and packages you install will be isolated from your global environment, making it easier to manage and maintain your project.

## Installing Dependencies


      
To install all the necessary dependencies for your project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will read the requirements.txt file and automatically install all the listed dependencies for you. Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running this command to ensure that the packages are installed in the correct environment. Once the installation is complete, you'll be ready to start working on your project!
